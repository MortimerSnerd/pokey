## What is this

Hell if I know.  Right now it's just a small project to play with SDL2 
and OpenGL with.  Using the latest Nim devel branch.

I did half-heartedly try to compile with --gc:arc to see how that is 
coming along, but didn't feel like chasing down the errors in printing 
unsigned ints in the v2 repr implementation just yet.
